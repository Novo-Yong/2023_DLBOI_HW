Reflection Questions (15 pts, 5 pts for each)\n","Provide detailed answers to the questions below:\n","\n","**Q1. Loss Function Comparison:**  \n","   What are the differences between Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss and Cross-Entropy (CE) loss?\n","\n","<u>***Answer:***</u>  Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is mainly used for multi-class classification whereas Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) is utilized for binary classification. In terms of implementation if CE loss is used in binary classification, it expects two output features, whereas BCE loss expects 1 output feature. The key distinction is that if one wants to generate output as a form of probability, you should use BCE loss because we can use sigmoid to process the single output as the loss function.\n","\n","**Q2. Model Architecture Modification:**  \n","   What motivated the specific changes you made to the model architecture?\n","\n","<u>***Answer:***</u> For the CE loss we need to ensure the last layer has a number of nodes equivalent to the number of classes. From previously mentioned in Q1, When CE loss when is used in binary classification, it expects 2 output features. That is why I change from **nn.Linear(256, 1)** to **nn.Linear(256, 2)**.\n","\n","**Q3. Adapting to CE Loss:**  \n","   In the original code configured for BCE loss, two major adjustments are needed for adaptation to CE loss. Analyze and explain the necessity for these changes, referring to the code below.\n","\n","```python\n","for images, labels in train_loader:\n","    images = images.cuda()\n","    images = images / 255.0\n","    labels = labels.cuda()\n","    optimizer.zero_grad()\n","    outputs = model(images)\n","\n","    # Change #1: Adaptation to the labels for CE loss\n","    labels = labels.long()  # Changed from labels.float().unsqueeze(1) for BCE loss\n","\n","    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)\n","    loss.backward()\n","    optimizer.step()\n","    total_loss += loss.item()\n","\n","    # Change #2: Predictions for CE loss\n","    train_predicted = outputs.argmax(-1)  # Changed from torch.sigmoid(outputs) > 0.5 for BCE loss\n","    train_correct += (train_predicted == labels).sum().item()\n","```\n","\n","<u>***Answer:***</u>\n","<u><br>Change #1:</u> For BCE loss, the labels are often in float format, representing the probability of belonging to a particular class. Typically, there are 0.0 for negative class, and 1.0 for positive class. Moreover, BCE loss expects the targets and predictions to have the same shape, there's a need to add an additional dimension using 'unsqueeze(1)' to match the out put shape from the model. In contrast, CE loss requires labels to be class indices (integers) rather than float values. For binary classification the labels should be 0 for one class and 1 for the other class. That why the code convert the label to a 'long' datatype. Moreover, there is no need for the additional dimension since CE loss expects the labels in this compact format.\n","\n","<u><br>Change #2:</u> For BCE loss, the model's output after sigmoid activation typically a value between 0 and 1, representing probability of belonging to the positive class. A threshold is used to convert this probability into a binary label which often uses the threshold of 0.5. However, with CE loss, the model's output consists of raw scores (logits) for each class. To determine the predicted class, it simply chooses the class with the highest raw score by using 'argmax(-1)'. It will return the index of the maximum value along the last dimension\n","\n","<br>Both of these changes are critical to ensuring that the model is trained correctly when switching from BCE to CE loss and that its predictions are interpreted correctly.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3sckGE8kG8i5"},"source":["#### Put Your Response Here:\n","\n","##### 1.
